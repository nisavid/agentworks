# Interface Decision Record: Agent Equipment Config

Status: Equipment Blueprint
Promotion state: planned

This Equipment Design Bundle describes desired behavior and includes the first
standard-library runtime engine slice for fluent CLI operations,
effective-config, config-diff, diagnostics, plain handoff promotion, authority
checks, projection classification, reusable consumer action decisions,
read-only authoring proposal and plan-generation output, reviewed
plan-artifact apply behavior, plus onboarding and migration apply output. It
does not implement Agent Equipment beyond this runtime slice, publish assets,
resolve secrets, mutate external systems, or implement harness controls.

## Requirement

Agent Equipment Config needs a shared configuration contract that equipment can
consume without depending on Repo Ops or any other higher-level equipment. The
current deliverable keeps the v0 contract source-aligned and provides the first
portable deterministic engine slice for the covered config behaviors.

## Vision alignment

The Works vision expects deterministic state, serialization, policy, and
side-effect boundaries to live outside model memory. Config should make
equipment behavior adaptable without burying policy in long skills or hidden
agent preference.

## Decision

Use a Repo Draft PRD, Equipment Design Bundle, validator gate, and portable
standard-library Python runtime slice for v0.

The PRD owns product requirements, user-facing operation vocabulary, MVP
blockers, and follow-up epic buckets. The v0 contract defines typed schemas,
namespaced schema fragments, explicit
load duties, Layer Precedence, Policy Authority, Config Safety Status, secret
references, migrations, effective-config output, config-diff output, semantic
validators, conflict diagnostics, and decision/mutation audit boundaries. The
implemented runtime slice computes deterministic effective-config and
config-diff output, diagnostics, plain handoff promotion, authority checks,
consumer action decisions, onboarding-plan load-contract proposals, and
projection classification. It also emits read-only `config propose`,
`config patch`, and `create-layer` artifacts for target-agnostic proposals,
selected-source patch plans, and new-layer plans, then applies reviewed
`patch-layer` and `create-layer` artifacts through `config apply`. Harness
adapters, arbitrary CLI fragment registration, blocking enforcement, and
general edit surfaces beyond reviewed plan artifacts remain separate work.

The consumption contract keeps the final action decision with the consuming
equipment. Shared Config output supplies evidence; the consumer maps that
evidence to `allowed`, `advisory`, `warning`, `blocking`, or `unsupported`
before mutation, external calls, hook execution, workflow changes, or durable
publication. Mutation-capable behavior fails closed unless effective Config is
`usable`, required authority and semantic validators pass, and the required
capability is supported.

The current operation surface includes fluent CLI operations for
`config resolve`, `config validate`, `config diff`, `config propose`,
`config patch`, `create-layer`, `config apply`, `onboard config`,
`migrate config preview`, and `migrate config apply`. MCP parity currently
covers those operation families through `config.resolve`, `config.validate`,
`config.diff`, `config.propose`, `config.patch`, `config.create_layer`,
`config.apply`, `onboard.config`, `migrate.config_preview`, and
`migrate.config_apply`.

Use TOML for human-authored config layers and plain equipment-specific config
handoff records. Use JSON-compatible objects for schemas, effective-config
output, config-diff output, diagnostics, audit records, and deterministic tool
output.

## Chosen surface

- Product requirements: `docs/prd/agent-equipment-config.md` owns the
  human- and agent-facing Config product shape, including CLI/MCP parity and
  Config Authoring Surfaces.
- Local docs: this Equipment Design Bundle owns the current v0 behavior and
  runtime slice boundary.
- Validator: `tools/validate_armory_integrity.py` recognizes the bundle and required
  v0 terms.
- Config: authored TOML layers and source category discovery are input to the
  portable runtime slice.
- Scripts/tools: `tools/agent_equipment_config.py` computes effective config,
  config diff, validation diagnostics, authoring proposals and plans,
  migration previews, and projection classification for the v0 slice.
- MCP/tools: typed MCP parity is required for the current operation families
  before #23 closes.
- Load contract: callers discover paths, select sources, order same-precedence
  inputs, register schema fragments, and pass explicit layer or handoff paths
  into the runtime; the runtime preserves layer, source category, source path,
  and trust provenance in output.
- Consumer integration: importable callers use `evaluate_consumer_config` to
  load effective Config and receive a consumer action decision, or
  `consumer_action_decision` to classify existing effective-config evidence.
- Hooks/permissions/approvals/sandboxes/tools: future enforcement projections.
- Skills: Smith/Wielder procedure around designing, onboarding, and repairing
  config. Skills route to CLI and MCP surfaces; they are not substitutes for
  those operation surfaces.
- Plugins and Agent Profiles: future packaging and specialized execution.

## Rationale

Config is lower-level equipment. If its shared machinery lives in Repo Ops,
Issue Tracker Ops and other primitives would inherit a dependency cycle. If
every equipment line invents its own config machinery, policy, safety status,
and audit shapes drift.

The bundle-first route lets the repo preserve the existing Blueprint material,
settle the v0 contract, and land a narrow portable engine before consumer and
harness integration. Updating the validator keeps the repository's deterministic
gate aligned with the current source and runtime shape.

## Alternatives rejected

- Build all runtime, consumer, onboarding, and harness enforcement behavior at
  once: rejected because those surfaces have different security and validation
  boundaries.
- Leave the flat spec as canonical: rejected because the Smith Runbook now uses
  Equipment Design Bundles for real Equipment Candidates that need capability,
  interface, security, pressure, validation, and closeout artifacts.
- Use a generic toy example as the main scenario: rejected because Issue Tracker
  Ops already provides realistic policy pressure without owning Config.
- Choose one universal config filename now: rejected because v0 should define
  source categories and projection duties before freezing harness-specific
  discovery paths.

## Load and harness-specific projection

Every later implementation slice must explain how Codex, OpenClaw, Hermes
Agent, Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenCode discover committed config, local-only
operator config, checkout-local state, session overrides, generated state, and
secret reference sources before invoking the runtime. Each projection must
distinguish path discovery, schema-fragment registration, provenance handling,
blocking controls, and advisory fallback.

## Risks

- The v0 contract could become too broad to implement. Child issues should keep
  engine, consumer integration, onboarding, harness projection, and enforcement
  work separate.
- Output examples could look like a final runtime schema. This bundle names the
  implemented portable slice and keeps consumer and harness-specific output
  commitments separate.
- Harness enforcement claims can drift. Harness projection slices must use
  Vanilla Harness Capability Profiles and current source-backed evidence.

## Maintenance notes

Review this decision when Issue Tracker Ops consumes Config directly, when a
harness projection gets blocking enforcement, or when repeated use shows that a
Config Safety Status or conflict diagnostic category is too coarse.
