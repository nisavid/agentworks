# AGENTS.md

## Project Role

Agentworks is a harness-refit workshop for agents: a home for creating and
equipping the equipment needed for an assigned task, domain, and context.

Do not narrow that purpose into a specific content model, methodology, directory structure, or toolchain before the repository itself does.

## Guiding Doctrine

Use **Efficient Coherence** as the guiding doctrine for agent work in this repo:
honor the Underlying Intent, match the rigor to the unresolved uncertainty, and
minimize spend within that quality boundary. See `docs/vision.md` for the full
doctrine.

- Intent before specification: treat prompts, issues, specs, plans, acceptance
  criteria, docs, and prior decisions as evidence of intent, not replacements
  for it. When literal compliance would miss the purpose, realign by
  correction, decomposition, clarification, or escalation.
- Rigor tracks uncertainty and consequence: scale thinking effort, context
  gathering, decomposition, reflection, review, and validation according to what
  remains unresolved and what failure would cost.
- Find the true simple shape: use inherent clarity, acceptable assumptions,
  separable layers, stable defaults, deterministic checks, reversible steps,
  bounded representations, and existing policy when they preserve the real
  problem. Do not flatten hard problems to make them appear simple.
- Guard against slop: watch for incoherent priors, poorly structured context,
  compaction loss, missing source evidence, vague prompt pressure, overbroad
  instructions, and urgency framing for work that needs deliberation. Apply the
  lightest control that materially reduces the risk.
- Minimize spend inside the quality boundary: once intent, rigor, simplicity,
  and slop controls are adequate, prefer lower token cost, time, operator
  attention, external side effects, and maintenance burden.

## Documentation Boundary

- Keep `README.md` human-facing and limited to the project's confirmed public shape.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` agent-facing and focused on durable guidance that is not obvious from scouting the files.
- Do not add inventories, command lists, setup notes, or status summaries here when an agent can discover them directly from the repository.
- Keep durable committed docs in neutral project paths named for their repository role, such as `docs/plans/`, `docs/prd/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/agents/`, `specs/`, `templates/`, or `examples/`.
- Do not place durable committed docs under a skill-, plugin-, tool-, or workflow-specific path unless the document is intrinsically about that specific skill, plugin, tool, or workflow.
- A neutral project doc may name the skill, plugin, tool, or workflow that should execute it; the file path should still reflect the document's repository role.

## Language and Concepts

- "Equipment for agents" means skills, MCPs, plugins, scripts, policy frameworks, workflows, agent roles, and other tools that an agent or agentic system can equip.
- Treat future terms of art as project vocabulary only after they appear in committed content or the user defines them.

## Agentworks Operating Contracts

- Use root `AGENTS.md` as the repo-local agent policy entrypoint. Keep detailed cross-Works operating-model rules in named Agentworks Operating Contract docs.
- Use `docs/story-closeout.md` for cross-Works closeout gate order, interdependency rules, review sequencing, and rerun rules.
- Use `docs/external-tool-evaluation.md` when an outside tool, framework,
  harness, service, dataset, or adjacent project may influence Works
  architecture, issue projection, documentation, security posture, or adoption
  decisions.
- Add or revise named Agentworks Operating Contract docs when cross-Works rules need more detail than `AGENTS.md` can carry durably.

## Forge Conveyor

Smiths creating or modifying Agent Equipment should start with:

- `docs/vision.md` for the Works, Forge, and Equipment experience goals that should guide ideation, architecture, design, strategy, validation, and maintenance.
- `docs/agent-equipment-forge.md` for the Forge overview.
- `docs/smith-runbook.md` for the equipment creation workflow.
- `docs/story-closeout.md` for closeout gate order, review sequencing, and rerun rules.
- `docs/equipment-delivery.md` when a task creates, revises, validates, or
  claims stockable Published Agent Equipment delivery surfaces.
- If the current equipment task reveals an unsatisfied Tooling Gap, use `docs/smith-runbook.md` for Tooling Request before continuing.
- `docs/interface-decision-guide.md` for choosing skills, MCP/tools, hooks, Agent Profiles, plugins, scripts, docs, and config.
- `docs/harness-capabilities.md` before making harness-specific claims.
- `templates/` for seed templates.
- `examples/` for annotated Forge Examples.
- `specs/` for Equipment Blueprints.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs are tracked in GitHub Issues for `nisavid/agentworks`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Reflection findings

Manual reflections that produce actionable equipment, policy, validator,
config, workflow, or documentation candidates should become issue-tracked
Reflection Findings. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Use the baseline issue label axes, triage comment rules, and triage-record
rules. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` and
`docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Domain docs

Use single-context domain docs. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Commit and PR Policy

- Use Conventional Commit subjects.
- Prefer concise scopes that name the affected domain.
- Nested slash-separated scopes are welcome when they communicate the change more precisely, for example `docs/readme` or `skills/install`.
- Before pushing changes to repo content, ensure any related or referencing repo content is updated accordingly.
- Before treating a change set as merge-ready, perform the security analyses applicable to that change set and record the commands, artifacts, findings, fixes, suppressions, or explicit non-applicability in the closeout.
- Before committing or externally projecting closeout evidence, classify each evidence artifact by durability. Commit or publish durable project evidence and portable review summaries; summarize instance-scoped scratch artifacts by scope, disposition, and durable conclusions instead of treating raw logs, reports, local paths, or tool work directories as project truth.
- Security closeout evidence belongs in the PR body, final change summary, issue tracker, or a neutral committed security document when the evidence is durable project material. Do not bury it in transient tool logs.
- Use Codex Security workflows when they apply. A change set that introduces or materially changes executable code, hooks, MCP/tool definitions, permissions, secrets handling, network/file/process side effects, package metadata, or security policy must receive a Codex Security scan or a documented reason why a narrower security action is sufficient.
- Resolve reportable security findings before merge-readiness, or record a stakeholder-approved deferment with the tracking issue and risk rationale.
- Near the end of every cohesive change set, and before treating it as merge-ready, inspect every agent-facing and human-facing doc that the change could plausibly affect. Update gaps, inaccuracies, stale status language, and appropriate mentions of the change-set deliverables.
- Apply the repo's doc-honing standards to that inspection: agent-facing docs must stay narrow, durable, and discoverable; human-facing docs must stay audience-fit, current, and free of maintainer-only clutter.
- If the inspection changes no docs, record the rationale in the PR body, final change summary, issue tracker, or neutral committed closeout document.
- Documentation closeout evidence belongs in the PR body, final change summary, issue tracker, or a neutral committed closeout document when the evidence is durable project material.
- Ralph-review documentation closeout changes with reviewer guidance that includes the applicable doc-writing standards: `honing-agent-facing-docs` for agent-facing docs, `honing-human-facing-docs` for human-facing docs, `writing-skills` for skill docs or skill-like instructions, `documentation-writer` for Diataxis structure, and `writing-clearly-and-concisely` for clear prose.
- Follow `docs/story-closeout.md` for closeout gate order, interdependency rules, review sequencing, and rerun rules.
- Before story closeout, run a Cross-Boundary Coherence Ralph Review that checks behavior and evidence across PRD, specs, plan, implementation, validation, security, docs, issue/PR projection, and release or handoff surfaces.
- Before story closeout, run a Story Quality Ralph Review that checks DX, UX, code quality, architecture, robustness against unspecified interactions and attack paths, lessons from prior pathological dev/ops cycles, and alignment with `docs/vision.md`.
- Once work is underway, agents may stage, commit, push, open PRs, update issues, and perform closeout steps when those actions advance the assigned work and respect the repository's current review, verification, and stakeholder boundaries.
- Do not force-push or perform destructive history operations unless the user explicitly asks for that action.

## Operating Policy

- This repository uses agentic engineering and operations. Agents should perform assigned tasks autonomously until they reach a boundary that requires stakeholder policy or an unavailable control surface.
- The user reserves authority over project initiatives and over initiation or continuation of work sessions. Within an active user-directed session, agents should drive execution, review loops, commits, publication steps, and cleanup unless escalation is required.
- Escalate when a decision or action impacts stakeholder concerns and the stakeholder's policy is unknown or uncertain.
- Escalate when an action must be taken but the agent lacks an autonomous control surface for it.
- When escalating a decision and a set of plausible, distinct choices is known, use a multiple-choice input tool if one is available in the interactive context. Include a way for the human operator to provide custom input.
- When escalating an action with a known prescribed path, present the steps clearly for the human operator to perform. Prefer fewer steps; present commands in easily copyable blocks, and prefer a single one-line command when practical.
- For every escalation, make the return contract clear: state exactly what result, confirmation, artifact, or output is needed to hand control back to the agent, and make it easy to validate.
- Prefer verified repository facts over guesses or aspirational guidance.
- When adding new agent-facing instructions, ask whether the information is durable, non-obvious, and useful before scouting a task.
- Remove guidance that becomes redundant with ordinary file discovery.
