# Forge Seed Source Disposition

Status: Source Retired

This ledger replaces raw source-handoff preservation after the source-bearing checkpoint. It does not preserve raw source payloads. It preserves source identity evidence, normalized source claim summaries, operator dispositions, source-bearing stamp fields, and source-retirement stamp fields without relying on chat history, host-local scratch artifacts, or Git object reachability.

## Source Manifest

Source-bearing snapshot tree id: `589bf626ffc5e9cdfffc7ee5983022adc1f7a1e2`
Allowed source list digest: `2e1198863b18b42b46b0d4661c23737ef12488f26a24d151bcd0a4847cbcbdcd`

`durable_payload` stores a durable digest or identifier, not raw source content.
This ledger preserves source identity evidence and normalized claim summaries
through digests and stamps.

## Disposition Items

Table legend: `operator_decision` is intentionally blank for
`challenge_status=unchallenged` / `disposition=kept_current` rows because no
operator arbitration decision was required. `normalized_claim_summary` remains
populated with retained claim coverage. Deferred/resolved rows record the
operator-directed decision and durable follow-up target.

## Challenge Lineage

No unresolved challenge enters source retirement. Rows marked `resolved` carry operator-directed post-Seed deferment decisions. Rows marked `unchallenged` are retained as disposition coverage already represented by current Forge Seed surfaces.

## Identity Maintenance

The Agentworks rename updates H012’s current evidence target to
`tools/validate_agentworks_integrity.py` and refreshes the disposition-table
checksum above. The recorded pre-rename checksum was
`e59e3bc4e9d11eb0198984bab87098c49c98be348bac38df7fef795d579f767f`.
Source identities, normalized claims, dispositions, and the original checkpoint
identity remain intact. This pointer maintenance does not repeat the historical
source-bearing or retirement qualification.

## Final Source-Retired Stamp
