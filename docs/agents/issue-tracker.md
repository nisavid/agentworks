# Issue Tracker

Preferred policy authority: `config/agent-equipment.toml`.

This document is a compatibility layer for active agent and skill dependents.
Use the Config layer for Issue Tracker Ops policy predicates, label axes,
operation dispositions, fallback rules, and audit expectations. Use this
document for readable workflow guidance over that Config authority. If these
surfaces conflict, the Config layer is authoritative.

Issues and PRDs for this repo live in GitHub Issues for `nisavid/agentworks`.

The current Issue Tracker Ops baseline is GitHub Issues without GitHub Projects
custom-field support. In that baseline, labels represent custom predicates such
as category and triage state, and out-of-band policy enforces exclusivity and
meaning. This is a dogfooding constraint, not a claim that labels are the best
long-term UX. Richer project fields remain future Issue Tracker Ops work. See
`docs/agents/triage-labels.md` for the current label axes.

Use `tools/issue_tracker_ops.py` for Issue Tracker Ops (Issue Ops) bootstrap
modes that describe the tracker-neutral core, describe the GitHub Issues
baseline adapter, describe advisory workflows, plan neutral operations and
advisory workflows, read, list, create, update, comment on, add dependency
relations, remove dependency relations, list dependency relations, read parent
relationships, manage supported native sub-issue relationships for GitHub
Issues, audit labels, and reconcile explicit fallback records.

Bootstrap adapter subcommands:

- `describe-core`
- `describe-workflows`
- `describe-adapter --adapter github-issues-baseline`
- `plan-operation --adapter github-issues-baseline --operation <operation-id>`
- `plan-workflow --adapter github-issues-baseline --workflow <workflow-id>`
- `read-issue`
- `list-issues`
- `create-issue`
- `update-issue`
- `comment`
- `add-blocked-by`
- `remove-blocked-by`
- `list-blocked-by`
- `list-blocking`
- `get-parent-issue`
- `list-sub-issues`
- `add-sub-issue`
- `remove-sub-issue`
- `reprioritize-sub-issue`
- `audit-labels`
- `reconcile-fallback`

The adapter defaults network operations to dry-run output; pass `--execute`
only when the active session allows the GitHub tracker operation. Mutation
`--execute` requires usable Config authorization or
`--mutation-policy-ref <ref>`. Config inputs take precedence and can still fail
closed.

The adapter can consume explicit Agent Equipment Config inputs with
`--config-layer <path>` and plain Issue Tracker Ops handoffs with
`--config-plain-handoff <path>`. It does not discover config paths. When config
inputs are supplied, dry-run output includes the effective Config evidence and
consumer action decision. For mutation subcommands, live `--execute` also
requires the effective `issue_tracker_ops.mode` value to be `execute`; blocking
or unsupported consumer decisions fail closed before any `gh` call.

Mutation commands perform live preflight reads under `--execute`. Exact
duplicate issue titles and duplicate comment bodies are blocked by default,
while exact no-op issue updates, already-applied or already-absent dependency
changes, and already-applied or already-absent sub-issue relationship changes
return `idempotent_skip` without writing. Use
`--if-duplicate return-existing` to return the matched item instead of failing,
or `--if-duplicate allow-with-reason --duplicate-override-reason <text>` when
the active policy explicitly allows a duplicate-prone write.

`list-issues` uses GitHub's REST issues endpoint and skips pull requests by
default because GitHub returns pull requests from issue list APIs. Use
`--include-pull-requests` only when the caller intends to inspect that mixed
endpoint output.

Use `--fallback-record-file <path>` only when a failed live mutation needs a
local record for later reconciliation. Fallback records use
`issue_tracker_ops.fallback_record.v1alpha1`; `reconcile-fallback` verifies the
intended tracker projection before retry or retirement, and `--retire-record`
updates the supplied fallback record only after projection is verified.

Use the `gh` CLI directly when a needed GitHub Issues operation is outside the
bootstrap adapter's current modes, such as GitHub Projects custom fields or
binary attachments, or when a skill needs a read-only query that is simpler
through `gh`.

Use `audit-labels` to dogfood the baseline label axes and detect missing or
conflicting axis labels across open issues. The command is read-only, but it
still follows the adapter convention: without `--execute`, it emits a dry-run
preview of the GitHub read and the axis policy. Pass
`--config-layer config/agent-equipment.toml` to audit the configured Issue Ops
policy axes; without Config input, the command uses its bootstrap defaults.

Use `describe-core` to inspect the tracker-neutral operation model, operation
classes, side-effect classes, capability dispositions, and audit requirements.
Use `describe-adapter --adapter github-issues-baseline` to inspect how the
current GitHub Issues baseline maps those operations to native, emulated,
unsupported, or fallback behavior. Use
`plan-operation --adapter github-issues-baseline --operation <operation-id>` to
inspect one operation plan before invoking adapter-specific commands.

Use `describe-workflows` to inspect advisory Issue Ops workflow contracts for
issue review, repair, enrichment, refactoring, assignment, duplicate review,
selection, session pickup, and issue-set orchestration. Use
`plan-workflow --adapter github-issues-baseline --workflow <workflow-id>` to
inspect the reads, candidate writes, policy factors, output sections, judgment
boundary, and adapter-mapped operation plans for one workflow. These workflow
commands are read-only planning surfaces: they do not call `gh`, do not require
`--execute`, and do not mutate the tracker. Accepted writes from a workflow
plan still need to be converted into deterministic Issue Ops operations and
run through the adapter's dry-run and write gates.

Use `skills/issue-ops-workflow-executor/SKILL.md` when an agent needs to apply
one of those advisory workflow plans. The skill requires the agent to consume
`describe-workflows` and `plan-workflow`, gather the workflow's required
context, emit the workflow's configured output sections, and keep candidate
writes as deterministic Issue Ops operation plans or dry-run command shapes.
Use `agents/issue-ops-workflow-executor/profile.toml` for a bounded advisory
worker shape that defaults to `github-issues-baseline`, allows read-only
workflow planning, and denies direct tracker mutation.

## Triage Comments And Records

Every comment or issue posted to the issue tracker during triage must start
with:

```markdown
> *This was generated by AI during triage.*
```

Use labels for current predicates and comments for the evidence, reasoning,
questions, briefs, and decision records that explain those predicates. A triage
record should be concise enough for humans and agents to scan, but specific
enough that the next handler can see the evidence boundary, unresolved factors,
and next action without reconstructing the whole session.

See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` for the current label axes and triage-record
template.

## Equipment Delivery Projection

When an issue or PR projects a published or delivery-compliant stockable
equipment claim, verify the stock record's linked Equipment Epic Closeout
Record under `docs/closeout/` before publishing the projection. Issue comments
may summarize the closeout record, point to it, or record tracker-specific
state, but they are not the delivery authority.

Do not treat an issue comment as sufficient evidence to close an equipment epic
as delivered when the stock record, shop card, inspection and test plan,
closeout record, advertised gear-up surfaces, or validation evidence is missing
or incomplete.

## Reflection Findings

A Reflection Finding is durable output from manual or ad hoc reflection that
may inform future equipment, Forge policy, validation, config, workflow, or
documentation.

Before external projection, classify privacy and disclosure limits for the
reflected content. Redact session context, speculative priorities, or
operator-sensitive material that should not become durable issue-tracker
content.

Create or update a GitHub issue when a reflection produces an actionable,
publishable candidate. Route the finding to the narrowest owner issue when one
is clear. When the finding informs generic Reflection or cognition equipment,
link it to [#25](https://github.com/nisavid/agentworks/issues/25).

Capture:

- session or work context;
- observed friction, failure, repeated pattern, or insight;
- induced equipment, policy, validator, config, workflow, or documentation
  candidate;
- routing target, parent issue, dependency, or deferment reason;
- evidence or source surface to scout later;
- confidence, urgency, and readiness;
- privacy or disclosure limits before external projection.

## Follow-Up Capture Fallback

GitHub Issues are the preferred active tracker for follow-up work. Use a local
follow-up capture only when a durable repo note is needed before issue
projection is available or appropriate.

Place fallback captures under `docs/follow-ups/<short-slug>.md`. Recreate that
directory only for unprojected fallback captures; do not use it as a parallel
tracker after GitHub Issues carry the active work.

Each follow-up capture should include:

- `Status: Follow-Up Capture`
- a `## Purpose` section,
- a `## Captured Requirements` section,
- a `## GitHub Issue Projection` section that explains why the GitHub issue is
  not created or updated yet.

Keep these captures narrow. They are not a general inventory, and they must not
remain as parallel trackers after projection. Once GitHub Issues carry the
active work, retire or consolidate the local capture and leave only durable
closeout or source-disposition evidence.
