# Agentworks documentation

This map helps human readers choose what to read and what to give to their
agents. Agentworks is under construction: the Forge has just come online,
and Agent Equipment Config has its first published runtime slice.

## Choose a path

- **Wielding a loadout**: start with the [Agentworks Vision](vision.md), then the
  [Forge Tour](forge-tour.md). For shared equipment configuration, use
  the [Agent Equipment Config shop card](equipment/shop-cards/agent-equipment-config.md),
  the [runtime guide](equipment/agent-equipment-config.md), and the
  [Config integration guide](equipment/agent-equipment-config-integration.md).
  Check the [stocked-equipment inventory](equipment/inventory.md) before
  treating any surface as current Works stock.
- **Outfitting a harness**: ask an outfitter to compare
  [harness capabilities](harness-capabilities.md),
  [harness components](harness-components.md), and
  [security and control](security-and-control.md) against the
  [Agentworks Vision](vision.md) before selecting a future loadout.
- **Evaluating the Works**: start with the [Agentworks Vision](vision.md) and the
  [Forge Tour](forge-tour.md), then use the
  [Forge Canon](agent-equipment-forge.md) and current [roadmap](#roadmap) to see
  what exists now, how equipment is made, and what is planned.
- **Procuring equipment**: check the current
  [stocked-equipment inventory](equipment/inventory.md), then review
  [equipment promotion](equipment-promotion.md) and
  [Published Equipment Delivery](equipment-delivery.md) to see what must be
  true before equipment is ready to use.
- **Commissioning new equipment**: have a smith start with the
  [Agentworks Vision](vision.md), [smith runbook](smith-runbook.md),
  [interface decision guide](interface-decision-guide.md), and
  [templates](../templates/).
- **Keeping equipment current**: ask the responsible agent to compare the
  [Agentworks Vision](vision.md),
  [harness capabilities](harness-capabilities.md),
  [security and control](security-and-control.md), and
  [equipment promotion](equipment-promotion.md).

## Start here

- [Agentworks Vision](vision.md): Efficient Coherence and the intended agent and
  operator experience behind the Works, the Forge, and Agent Equipment.
- [Forge Tour](forge-tour.md): human-facing orientation to the Works, the Forge,
  agent roles, and current construction state.
- [Forge Canon](agent-equipment-forge.md): core method for the Forge and component
  model.
- [Project context and language](../CONTEXT.md): glossary, relationships,
  precision rules, example dialogue, and ambiguity resolutions.
- [Agentworks identity](adr/0023-adopt-agentworks-identity.md): the current
  project name, current identifiers, and consumer migration requirements.

## Tutorials and guided examples

- [PR review example](../examples/pr-review/projected-components.md): how a PR
  review capability projects into equipment surfaces.
- [Documentation research example](../examples/docs-research/projected-components.md):
  how a documentation research capability handles evidence-backed claims.
- [Observability investigation example](../examples/observability-investigation/projected-components.md):
  how an investigation capability combines judgment, tools, docs, and checks.

These examples are teaching artifacts. They are not installable or published
agent equipment.

## Guides to hand to agents

- [Smith runbook](smith-runbook.md): give this to a smith when you want new or
  revised agent equipment.
- [Interface decision guide](interface-decision-guide.md): choose the right
  place for each equipment responsibility.
- [Equipment promotion](equipment-promotion.md): see how close an example,
  blueprint, or candidate is to being ready for inventory.
- [Published Equipment Delivery](equipment-delivery.md): use when a stockable
  release needs a shop card, stock record, component manifest, and delivery
  compliance status.
- [Work closeout](story-closeout.md): use when an agent needs to finish work
  cleanly, with checks, safeguards, docs, and review aligned.
- [External tool evaluation](external-tool-evaluation.md): use when an outside
  tool, framework, harness, service, dataset, or adjacent project may influence
  Works architecture, issue projection, documentation, security posture, or
  adoption decisions.

  contract for source review, evidence classification, security disclosure,
  projection, and final disposition of outside tools.
- [Security Best Practices Baseline](security/security-best-practices.md):
  current secure defaults for executable repository surfaces.
- [Templates](../templates/): starting points an agent can copy while making
  future equipment.
- [Agent Equipment Config](equipment/agent-equipment-config.md): published
  runtime slice with fluent CLI operations, MCP parity tools, a Codex plugin,
  and a routing skill for shared Config.
- [Agent Equipment Config shop card](equipment/shop-cards/agent-equipment-config.md):
  Wielder and Outfitter-facing stock card for the current Config surfaces.
- [Config integration guide](equipment/agent-equipment-config-integration.md):

## Roadmap

The current roadmap points to equipment lines that still have future slices:

- [Agent Equipment Config](../specs/agent-equipment-config/): shared,
  layerable, enforceable configuration across equipment; the
  [runtime slice](equipment/agent-equipment-config.md), Codex plugin, and
  routing skill are published, and the
  [integration guide](equipment/agent-equipment-config-integration.md) and
  [PRD](prd/agent-equipment-config.md) record the current user path and
  required CLI, MCP, and Codex plugin operation surfaces.
- [Issue Tracker Ops](../specs/issue-tracker-ops/): direct GitHub
  Issues baseline operations and future issue lifecycle equipment. Issue Ops
  is the accepted shorthand.
- [Existing Equipment Onboarding](prd/existing-equipment-onboarding.md): draft
  generic contract for discovering prior equipment, deciding compatibility and
  disposition, and reporting activation limits before an equipment line claims
  coverage.
- [Repo Ops](../specs/repo-ops.md): repository framework for agentic
  operations. Repo Ops is complete for repositories that are not forks.
- [Fork Ops](https://github.com/nisavid/agentworks/issues/87): planned
  Repo Ops add-on for fork-specific operations after Fork Ops source material
  and Repo Ops prerequisites are ready for intake.
- [Periodic Actions](../specs/periodic-actions.md): recurring agent actions
  across harnesses.
- [Vanilla Harness Capability Profiles](../specs/vanilla-harness-capability-profiles/):
  source-backed descriptions of supported harness integration surfaces, with
  manual profile validation and refresh tooling. The recurring refresh path
  remains future work.
- [Capability Profiling Protocol](../specs/capability-profiling-protocol/):
  reusable study-plan, study-report, and jig-adequacy structure for Capability
  Surface studies.
- [Agent Test Jigs and Harness Testing System](../specs/agent-test-jigs/):
  design package for controlled harness, equipment, Loadout, interaction, and
  Harness Capability validation. Implementation remains projected to follow-up
  issues.
- [Head Gear / Reflection and cognition equipment](https://github.com/nisavid/agentworks/issues/25):
  future generic cognition enhancement equipment that turns underspecified
  intent and recent agent experience into durable insight, routed follow-up, and
  harness improvements.
- [Portable workflow equipment](https://github.com/nisavid/agentworks/issues/8):
  future support for portable agent equipment.
- [Side-thread hand-back](https://github.com/nisavid/agentworks/issues/7):
  future support for side conversations around active work.
- [Ephemeral workflow opportunity capture](https://github.com/nisavid/agentworks/issues/9):
  future support for capturing useful workflow ideas during active sessions.

The GitHub issue tracker carries active story structure. The projected Forge
Seed follow-up captures are retired in
[Forge Seed Follow-Up Projection](closeout/forge-seed-follow-up-projection.md).
