# Agent Equipment Config Integration Guide

Status: Published integration guide
Promotion state: published

Use this guide when a Smith adds Agent Equipment Config support to equipment,
when a Wielder supplies Config to existing equipment, or when an Outfitter maps
Config into a harness, plugin, hook, skill, CLI, or MCP surface.

Authoritative contracts live in the
[Agent Equipment Config PRD](../prd/agent-equipment-config.md), the
[runtime guide](agent-equipment-config.md), and the
[Equipment Blueprint](../../specs/agent-equipment-config/). This guide explains
how those contracts fit together during integration. It does not replace the
spec, and it does not define new Config operation surfaces.

## Integration contract

Agent Equipment Config has an explicit-load contract:

1. A caller discovers the relevant layer and handoff paths.
2. The caller registers the consuming equipment's schema fragment.
3. The caller chooses the requested behavior, such as `advisory` or
   `mutation`.
4. Config resolves effective values, diagnostics, provenance, safety status,
   migration previews, and enforcement projection.
5. The consuming equipment turns that evidence into a consumer action decision.

The runtime does not discover files, import equipment packages, resolve secret
values, mutate external systems, or enforce harness controls. Source writes are
limited to registered `migrate config apply` operations and reviewed
`config apply` operations on eligible local TOML sources. `config propose`,
`config patch`, and `create-layer` provide non-migration authoring proposal and
reviewed plan generation. `config apply` consumes those reviewed plan artifacts
from a file or stdin and rechecks authority, source preconditions, validation,
semantic safety, secret boundaries, all-or-nothing behavior, and mutation audit
evidence before writing. Revision writes and richer audit/query behavior remain
Config Authoring Surfaces follow-up work outside reviewed plan-artifact apply.

The product operation vocabulary is:

| User intent | Product operation | Current runtime basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read, explain, and trace effective Config | `config resolve` | `effective-config` |
| Check readiness without dumping full output | `config validate` | effective-config validation and safety classification |
| Compare two effective outputs | `config diff` | `config-diff` |
| Propose authoring changes without a target | `config propose` | target-agnostic proposal artifact |
| Plan an authored source patch | `config patch` | read-only `patch-layer` reviewed plan artifact |
| Plan a new authored layer | `create-layer` | read-only `create-layer` reviewed plan artifact |
| Apply a reviewed authored source plan | `config apply` | reviewed plan-artifact apply |
| Plan first-run, resume, restart, or revise work | `onboard config` | `onboarding-plan` |
| Preview registered source migrations | `migrate config preview` | `migration-apply` without `--apply` |
| Apply registered source migrations | `migrate config apply` | `migration-apply --apply` |

The fluent CLI commands are the supported invocation surface. The runtime
command names remain available for implementation debugging and evidence
comparison.

MCP parity uses the same operation families with typed inputs and structured
outputs. Use MCP when the harness exposes these tools and an agent can operate
through typed arguments. Use the fluent CLI when MCP is unavailable, when a
human needs a copyable command, or when command output is the clearer review
artifact. See the [runtime guide's MCP parity section](agent-equipment-config.md#mcp-parity)
and the [MCP tools specification](../../specs/agent-equipment-config/mcp-tools.md)
for the authoritative MCP-to-CLI map.

## Smith path

Start with the equipment's plain session handoff. Keep that shape useful when
shared Config is absent, then register the same shape as a namespaced schema
fragment when shared Config is available.

A Config-aware equipment integration should:

- own its namespace, defaults, required fields, semantic validators, and
  registered migrations;
- pass layer paths and plain handoff paths explicitly;
- pass the requested behavior before evaluating effective Config;
- inspect `safety_status`, diagnostics, Policy Authority, secret references,
  migration previews, and `enforcement_projection`;
- produce a consumer action decision before mutation, external calls, hook
  execution, workflow changes, or durable publication;
- fail closed for mutation when the consumer decision is `blocking` or
  `unsupported`;
- keep generic layering, provenance, migration previews, and edit boundaries in
  Agent Equipment Config instead of reimplementing them locally.

Python consumers use the importable runtime when they need a direct decision:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from tools import agent_equipment_config

config = agent_equipment_config.evaluate_consumer_config(
    [Path("templates/config/agent-equipment-config-example.toml")],
    [agent_equipment_config.issue_tracker_ops_fragment()],
    equipment="issue_tracker_ops",
    requested_behavior="advisory",
    required_capabilities=[],
    supported_capabilities=["tracker_read", "tracker_write"],
)

decision = config["consumer_action_decision"]
if decision["state"] in {"blocking", "unsupported"}:
    raise RuntimeError(decision["reason"])
```

Use `consumer_action_decision` directly when the equipment already has
effective-config output and only needs to classify behavior against its
capability boundary.

## Wielder path

Choose Config sources by ownership and durability:

| Source | Use for | Portability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| committed durable config | project, repository, organization, or tracker policy | durable project truth |
| local-only operator config | machine-local choices and operator preferences | local only |
| checkout-local state | state tied to one checkout | local only |
| generated cache or state | generated evidence and cache state | generated, not source truth |
| secret reference source | pointers to secret providers or names | no secret values |
| session override | per-session choices and plain handoffs | session scoped |

Inspect effective Config before relying on it:

```bash
python3.14 tools/agent_equipment_config.py config resolve \
  --layer templates/config/agent-equipment-config-example.toml \
  --issue-tracker-ops \
  --requested-behavior advisory
```

Use validation output when a script or hook needs a lower-noise pass/fail
surface:

```bash
python3.14 tools/agent_equipment_config.py config validate \
  --layer templates/config/agent-equipment-config-example.toml \
  --issue-tracker-ops \
  --requested-behavior mutation
```

For the current Issue Tracker Ops consumer, pass Config to the adapter with
`--config-layer` or a plain handoff with `--config-plain-handoff`:

```bash
python3.14 tools/issue_tracker_ops.py comment \
  --repo OWNER/REPO \
  --issue-number 123 \
  --body "Config-aware dry-run comment" \
  --config-layer templates/config/agent-equipment-config-example.toml
```

The example layer keeps Issue Tracker Ops in `dry-run` mode. If a caller also
passes `--execute`, the adapter must refuse the write unless effective Config
supports live tracker mutation and the Issue Tracker Ops consumer decision is
non-blocking.

The adapter records that gate in
`config.consumer_enforcement_projection.surface =
"issue_tracker_ops.github_api_mutation_preflight"`. For mutation commands,
`adapter_action = "allow"` means the adapter called `gh`; `adapter_action =
"block"` means the adapter refused before any GitHub API mutation. The
projection records the effective Config Safety Status, diagnostic kinds,
consumer decision state, fallback, and `approval_behavior = "not_supported"`.
Issue Tracker Ops therefore blocks incomplete, unsafe, conflicted, stale,
untrusted, missing-authority, and unsupported mutation outputs, while preserving
safe dry-run fallback as advisory behavior.

Secret references remain unresolved until a provider-owning surface resolves
them. For example, an Issue Tracker Ops adapter may decide that
`issue_tracker_ops.github_token` needs an environment variable, but Agent
Equipment Config only reports the reference and safety status. The adapter,
harness, or operator-owned tool reads the environment variable, keychain, vault,
harness secret store, or external provider after it has accepted the Config
decision evidence.

Use a plain handoff when shared Config is absent but the consuming equipment has
a narrow session shape:

```bash
python3.14 tools/issue_tracker_ops.py comment \
  --repo OWNER/REPO \
  --issue-number 123 \
  --body "Config-aware dry-run comment" \
  --config-plain-handoff templates/config/issue-tracker-ops-plain-handoff.toml
```

Plain handoffs are session overrides. They are useful for continuity and
diagnostics, but they are not durable project policy.

### Authoring reviewed changes

Use the authoring CLI when a Wielder needs to change Config through the
reviewed plan contract:

1. Run `config propose` to describe the intended change without selecting a
   source.
2. Run `config patch` for an existing eligible layer, or `create-layer` for a
   new eligible layer, and review the JSON artifact.
3. Run `config apply --plan PATH --apply-authority operator`, or pass the
   reviewed artifact on stdin with `--plan -`.

The only eligible non-migration authoring targets are `committed durable
config` and `local-only operator config`. A committed target becomes project
truth after a successful apply and belongs in normal project review. A
local-only operator target remains local evidence and must not be represented
as durable project policy.

The reviewed plan artifact carries the selected source target, source category,
source identity, precondition fingerprint, authority evidence, validation
result, virtual post-change effective Config, refusal codes, durability
classification, and rollback stance. `config apply` rechecks those gates before
writing. Stale sources, missing authority, ineligible categories, untrusted
sources, invalid planned source shapes, unsafe virtual Config, direct secret
values, provider-metadata patch paths, and provider mutation attempts refuse
without changing sources.

## Outfitter path

Outfitters decide where a harness or bundle discovers inputs and exposes Config
operations. Keep these responsibilities separate:

- Harness, plugin, hook, skill, or script code discovers candidate paths,
  chooses applicable sources, orders same-precedence inputs, and registers
  schema fragments.
- Agent Equipment Config resolves and validates the supplied inputs.
- Consuming equipment turns Config evidence into behavior-specific action
  decisions.
- Secret provider adapters resolve referenced secrets outside the core Config
  runtime and own the value lifetime, error handling, and private audit boundary.
- Harness controls decide whether a decision becomes advisory evidence,
  approval friction, or a hard block.

Expose the fluent CLI operation names and MCP parity names from the PRD when
designing user-facing surfaces. Use runtime commands only for implementation
debug evidence. Do not turn a skill or prose guide into the product operation
surface.

When exposing MCP, wrap `tools.agent_equipment_config.mcp_tool_definitions()`
and `tools.agent_equipment_config.call_mcp_tool()` rather than hand-copying
the Config operation behavior. The standalone stdio wrapper is
`python3.14 tools/agent_equipment_config_mcp_server.py`; use it when a harness
can launch an MCP server, and use the fluent CLI commands as the fallback when
MCP is unavailable or a command transcript is the clearer evidence surface. The
current MCP layer classifies
`config.resolve`, `config.validate`, `config.diff`, `config.propose`,
`config.patch`, `config.create_layer`, `onboard.config`, and
`migrate.config_preview` as read-only or read-only policy decision tools. It
classifies `config.apply` and `migrate.config_apply` as local writes that
require per-call `apply_authority = "operator"` for the MCP tool, plus their
source category, trusted provenance, projected safety, precondition, and audit
gates. See [`config.apply`](../../specs/agent-equipment-config/mcp-tools.md#configapply),
[`migrate.config_apply`](../../specs/agent-equipment-config/mcp-tools.md#migrateconfig_apply)
and [Migration apply](agent-equipment-config.md#migration-apply) for the full
contracts. Authoring MCP tools use typed changes for proposal and plan
generation, reviewed `agentworks.config.authoring-plan.v1` artifacts for
apply, stable refusal codes, all-or-nothing local source mutation, and audit
output that records durability classification, project-truth status, and
rollback stance.

For Codex, use the repo-owned plugin under
`plugins/agent-equipment-config/` when the surface should equip routing
guidance, MCP launch configuration, and local-write hook friction together. The
plugin source is exposed through `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`; Codex
installs local plugins into its cache. The bundled MCP launcher prefers
`AGENTWORKS_ROOT` when it points at a trusted live Works checkout; otherwise,
it checks the working directory and its parents. A matching checkout must
contain the server marker (`tools/agent_equipment_config_mcp_server.py`),
inventory marker (`inventory/equipment.toml`), and `agentworks` repo marketplace
marker (`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`). Use a trusted checkout for either
discovery path. It changes directory to that checkout
before executing the standalone MCP server. Keep behavior in the standalone
runtime and MCP server; the plugin routes to those contracts instead of
reimplementing them.

Before publishing an integration surface, document:

- which layer categories the surface can discover;
- which categories are committed, local-only, generated, secret-reference, or
  session-scoped;
- which Config operation family the surface exposes;
- which schema fragments it can register;
- which provider owns each secret-reference `kind` and how secret names are
  redacted in user-facing output;
- what side effects the consuming equipment may perform;
- how `blocking` and `unsupported` decisions are enforced or handed back;
- where audit evidence and refusal records appear.

## Integration checklist

- Link to the Config PRD, runtime guide, and Equipment Blueprint instead of
  restating unstable internal detail.
- Keep all source selection explicit; do not add hidden default discovery to
  the core runtime.
- Keep secret values out of Config and examples; use secret references and let
  provider-owning adapters resolve values after Config classification.
- Keep local-only paths out of durable examples.
- Demonstrate at least one dry-run path before live mutation.
- Treat `blocking` and `unsupported` as stop signals for mutation-capable
  behavior.
- Record validation, security, and documentation closeout evidence for every
  implementation slice that changes executable code, Config policy, operation
  surfaces, source writes, or harness enforcement.
